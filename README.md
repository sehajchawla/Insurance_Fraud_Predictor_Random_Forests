# Insurance_Fraud_Predictor_Random_Forests
This repository uses the popular random forests algorithm (coded from first principles) to classify someone as creditable or not creditable.

The algorithm generates the decision trees by itself, using the most simple dependency possible- math!

I have generated three random forrests in this project of sizes 1, 5, and 10, and we can see in the output (attached PNG file) that as the number of trees increases, the mean accuracy goes up, the hghest being at approximately 61% in the forrest with 10 trees.

The dataset is from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+(German+Credit+Data)
